single subliminal frame locating softwares coded un puredata+python 


I was decanting a bottle of Glenlivet with my Pops and watching Danny Boyle's Sunshine on amazon prime.  I pointed out to him a few single frames of the deceased crewmembers from Icarus1 Mr. Boyle had single frame subliminally edited in to the boarding scene.  My Dad0's mind reeled with paranoia fantasy of directors who would try this thing to manipulate their audience.  He thought, if a Brittish director would try it, certainly the liberal media would attempt this skunk works subterfuge.  He enlisted to write this software so he can now analyze the streams of media and not worry about SUBLIMINAL MIND CONTROL

In order to run this software you need to have pure data installed with the extra libraries.  In a debian or ubuntu system, you should be able to 
#sudo apt-get install pd-extended 
if that doesn't work, goto puredata.info and download the extended stable build for your system.

Now you should be able to run the program by invoking
#pd-extended 1..blink.for.cuts.pd

the system will prompt you to select a video file, it is recommended your video has 640x480 resolution for semblance of reasonable processor load.
