single subliminal frame locating softwares coded un puredata+python 


I was decanting a bottle of Glenlivet with my Pops and watching Danny Boyle's Sunshine on amazon prime.  I pointed out to him a few single frames of the deceased crewmembers from Icarus1 Mr. Boyle had single frame subliminally edited in to the boarding scene.  My Dad0's mind reeled with paranoia fantasy of directors who would try this thing to manipulate their audience.  He thought, if a Brittish director would try it, certainly the liberal media would attempt this skunk works subterfuge.  He enlisted to write this software so he can now analyze the streams of media and not worry about SUBLIMINAL MIND CONTROL
